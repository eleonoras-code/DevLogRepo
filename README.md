DevLog is a simple and fast journaling app designed for developers who want to track their personal achievements, daily progress, and technical discoveries.
The app stores entries locally, requiring no login or external account. Your thoughts stay on your device—fully private and always accessible.

This project was built with SwiftData, with a learning focus on:
1) Data persistency
2) Modeling data and relationships
3) Local storage mechanisms
4)Efficient handling of text, dates, and images

The app currently allows the user to: 
1) Create rich entries with text, date, and images
2) Local data storage using SwiftData
3) Edit existing entries
4) Delete entries safely
5) No login required
6) Fast, private, offline-first experience

Each journal entry includes:
1) Text: Your notes, thoughts, or logs
2) Date: Automatically stored and editable
3) Images: Optional images attached to each entry
SwiftData handles persistence, ensuring all entries are safely stored on-device.


Building DevLog offered hands-on experience with:
1) SwiftData setups and schemas
2) Managing relationships between models
3) Understanding how SwiftUI interacts with persistent data
4) App state updates when editing, adding, or deleting entries
